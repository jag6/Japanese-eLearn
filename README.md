# Japanese-eLearn
This is a simple app that I created to help me learn Japanese words, phrases, etc. It can obviously be reapplied to learn anything that fits in the traditional flash cards learning style. What you want to learn can be saved as variables and then entered in to a variable list. This way variables can be easily found and deleted once the learning objective has been achieved.

This program in its present state is just meant to be run in the terminal. If python has already been installed, then simply type in python touch.py (or python3 touch.py) to get the program going.
