# Japanese-eLearn
This is a simple program that I created to help me learn Japanese words, phrases, etc. It can obviously be reapplied to learn anything that fits in the traditional flash cards learning style. What you want to learn can be saved in multi-dimensional list. This way the content can be easily found and deleted once they've been learned.

This program in its present state is just meant to be run in the terminal. If python has already been installed, then simply type in either python or (python3) touch.py or python touch2.py depending on your learning style preference to get the program going.
