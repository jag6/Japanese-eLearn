# Japanese-eLearn

## What is this?
This is a simple program that I created to help me learn Japanese words, phrases, etc. It can obviously be reapplied to learn anything that fits in the traditional flash cards learning style. What you want to learn can be saved in a multi-dimensional list. This way the content can be easily found and deleted once they've been learned.

## How to Run It
This program in its present state is just meant to be run in the terminal. If python, ruby, or node.js has already been installed, then simply type in either python (python3), node, or ruby followed by the name of the file to get the program going. 

### Examples
- python touch.js
- node touch2.js
- etc.
